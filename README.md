# Weather App

> A React/Redux application that allows a user to search for weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

This was my fifteenth project at Origin Code Academy. This app was made using React and Redux.

## Background

## Approach

I took a mobile-first approach with this app and created a responsive design contingent on the dimensions of the device screen.
